### Added
A Raspberry Pi example

### Fixed
- Error in the month/weekday setting

## [0.1.1] - 2021-07-21

### YANKED FROM CRATES.IO!

### Fixed
- Make sure that non relevant bits in the time and date register are ignored before the decoding, following this hint in the datasheet: *Bit positions labelled as x are not relevant. Bit positions labelled with N should always be written with logic 0; if read they could be either logic 0 or logic 1* - fix by [pyaillet](https://github.com/pyaillet)
- Error in the month/weekday setting

## [0.1.0] - 2021-04-05

### Changed

- Get and clear Voltage Low detector flag
- Get external clock mode flag status
- Get main clock status (running/stopped)
